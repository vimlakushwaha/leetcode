our  code defines a class `Solution` with a method `minOperations` that calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of a subarray from the input list `nums` equal to a given `targetSum`. Let's break down the code step by step:
​
1. Calculate the total sum of all elements in the `nums` list and store it in the variable `totalSum`.
​
```python
totalSum = sum(nums)
```
​
2. Calculate the target value as the difference between `totalSum` and `targetSum`. This target value represents the sum that needs to be achieved by modifying the subarray.
​
```python
target = totalSum - targetSum
```
​
3. Check if the target value is negative. If it is, it means that the target sum is not achievable, so the function returns -1.
​
```python
if target < 0:
return -1
```
​
4. Check if the target value is zero. If it is, it means that the target sum is already zero, and you can achieve it by selecting all elements of the array. In this case, return the length of the `nums` list as the result.
​
```python
if target == 0:
return len(nums)
```
​
5. Get the length of the `nums` list and store it in the variable `n`.
​
```python
